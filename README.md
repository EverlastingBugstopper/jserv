# `jserv`

This is a small wrapper around [`node-static`](https://npmjs.com/package/node-static) that allows you to serve a single JSON endpoint from a server. This is most useful when developing features that require a JSON server and you want to test its behavior.

## Usage

**Serve a single json file from all endpoints:**

`npx jserv ./data.json`
